This repository showcases examples and implementation tips for
user-interface elements that provide access to OpenType fonts.

In particular, it focuses on user experiences beyond the generic
font-chooser menu, including:

    [Smart font features](examples/smart-font-features.md)
	[Variable font functionality](examples/variable-fonts.md)
	[Multi-layer color fonts](examples/color-fonts.md)
	[Emoji fonts](examples/emjoi-fonts.md)
	[Font metadata](examples/font-metadata.md)

This information is intended to be useful for open-source and
free-software projects, and all of the applications discussed in the
examples are free and open-source.

However ... this information is free for everyone to study and draw
inspiration from, regardless of what sort of project (if any) they may
be working on.
